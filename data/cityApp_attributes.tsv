DVRPC works to promote regional cooperation
in a 9-county, bi-state region. The region includes Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery (the county where Abington Township is located and the third largest Pennsylvania county), and
Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania; and Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey. DVRPC facilitates city, county and state representatives of this region to address key concerns
such as transportation, land use, environmental protection and economic development. 

DVRPC conducts a regional Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory on a 5-year interval, with the most recent inventory reflecting year 2010 conditions as summarized below:

1. DVRPC conducted a baseline inventory in 2005 which may be found at http://www.dvrpc.org/reports/09038A.pdf (Abington's results may be found on line 1 of page 66 or A-13 of this document under the Table ""Montgomery County, PA – 2005 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allocated to Municipality (MTCO2E)""; 
2. A 2010 inventory for which Abington Townships results may be found at http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/MunicipalEnergy/mcdDetail.aspx?mcdcode=4209100156 under ""GHG Emissions by Sector"" which is further broken down at the end under ""Non-Energy Greenhouse Gas Emissions.""  The 2010 results are what is being reported for this questionnaire."

Decreased	The decrease is very slight (<0,1%). An exact reason cannot be given. It probably has to do with the fact that outdoor temperatures were lower in 2015 than in 2014 and an increase of economical activity. Despite these curcumstances it is a decrease of emissions. This can be an indication that climate policies have a positieve affect, though not very strong.

The GPC level selected for the 2013 reports was BASIC. This level will serve as a baseline for more comprehensive reports in the future. This report included emissions from electricity and natural gas consumption, vehicles, city-owned landfills, municipal solid waste (MSW) generated inside the city but sent to landfills outside city limits, and emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), and the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (excluding aviation fuel emissions).

The emissions for 2009 were 10,857 ktCO2e (our last emissions inventory). The emissions for 2013 were 10,955 ktCO2e (our most recent emissions inventory). The main driver of the increase was the increased emissions from the industrial processes and product use sector. Over the same timeframe, the population increased by 5.0 per cent and the GDP increased by 8.4 per cent. Subsequently, the emissions intensity by population decreased from 7.6 to 7.3 tCO2e per capita. Similarly the emissions intensity by GDP decreased from 160 to 149 tCO2e per million $NZ (2009/2010 price). Overall, the emissions intensity has reduced and there is evidence that emissions are decoupling from population and economic growth.

These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry.
GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. 
GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases.
A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration.
GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay,  For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.

Decreased	The last GHG inventory performed for the Town of Blacksburg was in 2012. Over those three years decreased emissions from electric utility provider's fuel mix has resulted in decreased emissions in the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Considering the population increase it is likely that the culture of electricity use may have also lead to decreased consumption. Transportation emissions have increased by 1.39% which is likely due to the 3.29% increase in population. Wastewater emissions are significantly lower because of errors made in the previous emission calculations. Emissions from solid waste have also decreased roughly 4.4%.

Actual measurements are available for electricity, natural gas, and steam (obtained directly from energy utilities), and all sources related to mass transit, the airport, and water and sewer (obtained from the regional authorities). Regional transportation models are used to calculate vehicle-miles-traveled in Boston, which are then split into diesel and gasoline based on the State diesel and gas consumption split. Then each fuel type is divided into the average fleet mix categories (ICLEI 2009) and the EPA emissions factor for each vehicle type are applied to calculate the GHG. A 10% ethanol content for gasoline is also accounted for.  Fuel oil consumption is estimated based on sampling, U.S. Census data, and some state consumption figures.	Decreased	Overall GHGs decreased by about 2,000 metric tonnes, or 0.03%. This could be in part because there was only a small increase in heating degree days (HDD) from 2013 to 2014 (6.5%), and natural gas used declined more than 4.5%. Meanwhile the electricity emissions factor fell by a few points, while electricity use increased only 1.2%.

It may be explained, among others factors, because of improvement of the mitigation measures in the Waste Sector: new technologies which have been implemented in order to reduce the volume of waste disposed in landfills. Even though, during 2014, the city recorded the longest heat wave in its history, which has led to an increase in energy consumption for air conditioning and in general a higher residential use of electricity; however, the reductions in the 2014 inventory were achieved by the diminution on natural gas consumption as well as the reductions done in the waste sector,  which in the end managed to diminish the impact of electricity energy subsector. Regarding transport sector, the City has sold little bit less fuel than last year, which is shown in a small decreases of the sector's emissions.
Regarding the evolution of total GHG emissions in the period 2000 - 2014, an increase of 17% is observed. However, in the last 10 years (2005- 2014),the increase was 13%.

However, the ACT Government is required to record its own electricity, gas and transport data as this is not provided by the national government at the ACT scale.	Increased	The ACT emissions have increased by 4.6% since the last inventory. This is largely due to two external factors. The first is the National repeal of the carbon price, which saw a higher percentage of supplied energy come from fossil fuels, increasing the emissions factor for the electricity grid despite the ACT’s own renewable energy coming online. The second was a below average minimum winter temperatures which are linked to more days requiring heating for households. The slight increase in demand for electricity, coupled with the increased emission factor saw a spike in emissions from the electricity sector compared to last year.

All data provided in this CDP submission is based on this report.
The process includes: A baseline data collection was collected from the following 5 sectors. Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category. 
Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated  into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities. Local Government: all municipal operations, namely council buildings, street and traffic lights, water and wastewater treatment works and municipal vehicle fleet. Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train)

The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors.

In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor). Also included within the category energy industries is the municipal distribution losses."	Decreased	The City of Cape Town does not update its emissions inventory annually, but rather in a process linked to the update of its entire energy profile, which takes place every 4-5 years. In comparison to its last full inventory data (2007), Cape Town's emissions have decreased due to an increase in electricity efficiency between the reporting years  (2007 and 2012).

Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City.

Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015.

The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city."

This information is provided to us in various reporting categories such as residential, commercial and industrial. We are now receiving this information at the finest level of granularity that can be provided from the utilities. Propane fuel use for transportation is taken from Statistics Canada as recorded for the Province of Alberta, and then prorated according to the population of Edmonton compared to the population of Alberta. The diesel and gasoline use in litres is done in a similar fashion, but the information in this case is provided to us from the Alberta provincial government. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor. The conversion factors are derived from various sources: electricity grid intensity comes from Statistics Canada - this factor, is always two years behind the calendar year; natural gas and liquid fuels from US Environmental protection Agency, or Natural Resources Canada references, and the local utilities. The data is input manually each year into an excel spreadsheet model, and the conversion factors are checked for updates each year. Reports on the results are sent out on an as needed, customized basis.	Increased	"The changes from the 2013 dataset are as follows:Residential increased slightly, likely due to an increase in about 9,000 customers over the year, commercial increased energy consumption possibly due to a slight expansion in numbers, industrial showed a small decrease in emissions but we can't determine why, it was very much the same as 2013 values. All the vechicle fuel consumption numbers: gasoline, diesel, propane, natural gas for vehicles were very much the same as for 2013, ""Other"" emissions went up slightly due to an increase in some industrial sector emission due to production increases.

London's emissions fell by 11% on 1990 levels, and, significantly, despite an unprecedented increase in London's population, London's per capita emissions remain the UK's lowest at 4.8 tonnes.

As a result, overall natural gas use was up by eight percent in 2014 compared to 2013.

Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the peak in 2007. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions were 19 percent lower than 2007. In fact, London's emissions in 2014 were six percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to.

Greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity are significantly lower in 2014 (about 80 percent) than their peak in 2003. In 2014, only 0.1 percent of Ontario's electricity demand was generated by burning coal as these plants were shut down, and 10 percent was generated by burning natural gas. The rest of Ontario's electricity demand was met with emissions-free generation: 62 percent nuclear, 24 percent hydroelectric, 4 percent wind and other renewables.

Conservation and peak demand reduction programs also contribute to lower emissions from power generation. Unfortunately, lower demand from the economic slow-down in manufacturing sector also contributes to lower emissions."

Decreased	Emissions decreased from is 18.4 to 18 million tonnes between 2012 and 2013. This represents a change from our 2015 GHG emissions tonnage figure.

This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold.

CO2 emissions decreased as a whole
 This is partially due to a decrease in the electricty national emission factor (due to better technologies and to the increasing quota of renewable energy sources ). Anyway if we calculate the emission inventory in 2005 and 2013 with the same electricity emission factor there is still a decrease in emissions
Despite a litlle increase in population there was a reduction both in the bulding and in the mobility sector. Regarding buildings there was a progressive fuel switch from diesel oils to methane, more efficient boilers, an extension of the district heating service and a reduction in domestic electricity consumption.
We registered also a decrease in traffic that together with the renovation of circulating vehicles generated a decrease of CO2 emissions in the mobility sector"	Milano Urban Area Cluster	606.1875	621.1875	627.0625	1337.4375	1394.9375	1478.0	0.311885008682	0.305777750431	0.297883079481	0.688114991318	0.686653950283	0.702116920519	321.84610333	3454.35124422	322.027547583	3373.6480499	330.684703427	3413.31041964	2.01	2.14	1.8	2013	9.0%	5.6	33.0	137.0	0.3	72	0.01	61%	54%	35.0	71.0	56.0	69.0	79.0	46.0	15.0	14.0	23.0	61.0	73.66	38.0	RA	312.108	41147.0	3728678.0	1350680.0	2.76059318269			11946.7556102			5	0.0119467556102	3.12108e+11

Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame. LEED certification and Energy Star are examples of growing programs that help improve building energy efficiency.

We are thus still reporting 2015 data as before (note that our emissions data submitted April 2016 - for the year 2010 - were updated for the Compact of Mayors module submitted in December 2016 - for the year 2015).  However, due to limitations associated with the data, year to year comparisons must be made with caution.   

In general, emissions over the past few years appear to be staying the same or potentially decreasing slightly despite population increases.  This is likely due to more efficient building construction, reduction in solid waste tonnages, increased recycling and organics diversion, and increased fuel efficiency standards."																				1.16	1.17	2.7	2011																									93765.1667783	52898.0	1.77256544252	1.39970109752	2.14542978752				5

Recalculating 2003 and 2008 inventories to compare to the 2013 inventory shows that emissions have decreased by about 4% since the 2008 inventory, but have still increased by 10% since 2003. Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region. Natural gas emissions increased almost three-fold since 2003.

It is based on the methodology and toolkit developed by ARPA ER (Environmental Protection Agency of Emilia-Romagna Region) within the instrument IPSI (Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the Covenant of Mayors - Italian version). The methodology was improved and adapted by a specific working group “Climate Plan”  at regional level including the main cities and Provinces. The background knowledge is based on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory realized by the Region with the support of ARPA ER, following standard estimation methodologies, internationally recognized (IPCC, CORINAIR). The MEI includes: direct emissions of the Municipality considered as an organization with its own consumptions; indirect emissions, generated by activities within the Municipal area estimated by ARPA ER as a breakdown of the regional inventory. According to the European and Regional methodology, activities within ETS (Emissions Trade System) are not taken into account.

In comparison to the last Inventory made for the city, which has 2005 as the base year, there was a significant increase in emissions (around 75%) mainly due to the start of operations in 2010 of a new steel mill plant inside the city border, TKCSA."

During November 2015, the city reshaped and scoped calendar year 2012 emissions according to the new GPC BASIC framework to Compact of Mayors requirements.  The GPC expanded the scope of the verified 2012 inventory to report sources such as from natural gas leakage from the distribution system, district electricity, transmission and distribution electric losses, wastewater, agriculture/farming, ships and boats (non-ferry), off-road equipment and stationary sources.  This resulted in a higher emission number than originally verified by a third party.	N/A	"Methology Change: There was an increase in the emission number from inventory years 2010 to 2012.  The shift to the BASIC GPC framework during 2015 included categories that were otherwise excluded or not calculated during previous CDP reporting years.  Rather than rectify previous years, especially under the new GPC BASIC categories in which historic data is largely unavailable, CDP/COM reports will include these categories moving forward. 

However, to capture emission trends since 1990, the City will continue trending according to previously utilized ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol scopes in which case sectors such as Residential, Commercial/Industrial, Transportation (private, commercial, public/mass transit), Waste as well as Municipal emissions continues to decrease due to the City of San Francisco's progressive climate policies and commitment to implementing effective emission reduction strategies."

Decreased	"The total amount of GHGs emitted from the core emissions sources has declined 6% between 2008 and 2014, from 3.7 to 3.5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e).  However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%.
Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period).
Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs.

This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008.

A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions."

The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. Electricity use is however quite constant. The car traffic is constant in the last years even though the population has increased. However, there has been an increase in truck traffic.

a. Energy Heating and Cooling:
The City of Toronto’s emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are updated annually and based on the National Inventory Reports (Environment Canada); however, the City of Toronto adds a 10% transmission loss to the NIR figure. Additionally, data is acquired from Toronto Hydro and Enbridge Gas on the electricity and natural gas consumption of the entire city, including residential, industrial, commercial, institutional etc...

b. Transportation: 
Data are collected and standardized only for car and truck traffic through the City using four main sources: 
-truck traffic counts of over 2,000 intersections throughout the city from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
-accumulated traffic count data from years 1987 to 2009 from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
--a Canadian standard developed by a Canadian consultant

The above traffic data is then used to calculate “vehicle kilometers traveled” (VKT) and emissions factors for vehicle types are applied to calculate total emissions from mobile sources.

c. Waste: 
Tonnages of waste and approximate waste compositions are used in mass balance equations in the calculation of emissions from landfills."	Decreased	"a.  Eliminating the use of coal in the electricity mix which facilitated substantive per capita reductions in energy consumption
b.  Significantly reducing the amount of waste going to landfill, and therefore, the amount of methane gas generated

Our transportation emissions have remained the same because we have not been able to update this data for the year 2012 and so we used the same data from 2011 for our inventory."
