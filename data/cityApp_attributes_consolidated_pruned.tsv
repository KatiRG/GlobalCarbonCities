in a 9-county, bi-state region. The region includes Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery (the county where Abington Township is located and the third largest Pennsylvania county), and
Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania; and Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey. DVRPC facilitates city, county and state representatives of this region to address key concerns
such as transportation, land use, environmental protection and economic development. DVRPC conducts a regional Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory on a 5-year interval, with the most recent inventory reflecting year 2010 conditions as summarized below: 1. DVRPC conducted a baseline inventory in 2005 which may be found at http://www.dvrpc.org/reports/09038A.pdf (Abington's results may be found on line 1 of page 66 or A-13 of this document under the Table ""Montgomery County, PA – 2005 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allocated to Municipality (MTCO2E)""; 
2. A 2010 inventory for which Abington Townships results may be found at http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/MunicipalEnergy/mcdDetail.aspx?mcdcode=4209100156 under ""GHG Emissions by Sector"" which is further broken down at the end under ""Non-Energy Greenhouse Gas Emissions.""  The 2010 results are what is being reported for this questionnaire."

11	Amsterdam	CDP	2016.0	CO2	Local standard based on electricity, gas, district heat en local transportation.	Decreased	The decrease is very slight (<0,1%). An exact reason cannot be given. It probably has to do with the fact that outdoor temperatures were lower in 2015 than in 2014 and an increase of economical activity. Despite these curcumstances it is a decrease of emissions. This can be an indication that climate policies have a positieve affect, though not very strong.

The emissions for 2009 were 10,857 ktCO2e (our last emissions inventory). The emissions for 2013 were 10,955 ktCO2e (our most recent emissions inventory). The main driver of the increase was the increased emissions from the industrial processes and product use sector. Over the same timeframe, the population increased by 5.0 per cent and the GDP increased by 8.4 per cent. Subsequently, the emissions intensity by population decreased from 7.6 to 7.3 tCO2e per capita. Similarly the emissions intensity by GDP decreased from 160 to 149 tCO2e per million $NZ (2009/2010 price).

32	Belo Horizonte	CDP	2013.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	"GHG emissions by fuel consumption -Different concentrations of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) were established by the national authority for the distribution of Automotive Gasoline and Diesel. These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry. GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system.
It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay,  For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.
Composting - BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane."

Decreased	The last GHG inventory performed for the Town of Blacksburg was in 2012. Over those three years decreased emissions from electric utility provider's fuel mix has resulted in decreased emissions in the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Considering the population increase it is likely that the culture of electricity use may have also lead to decreased consumption. Transportation emissions have increased by 1.39% which is likely due to the 3.29% increase in population.

Decreased	Emissions for Energy sector in 2015 are reduced because the projection is from the emissions inventory for 2012 , because the emission factor has a high confidence in compración to that used in 2008. GHG emissions in the waste sector decreased because the mitigation measures as burning torch and recovery of biogas for energy self-generation are implemented. Emissions of greenhouse gases have increased for the ASUS sector compared to 2014, because they were projected of the emissions inventory of greenhouse gases of the year 2008, from growth data of the bovine population, ecological structure principal, agriculture in Cundinamarca, and production of products of wood, which have an increasing trend over time.

43	Boston	CDP	2014.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	For its inventory, the City of Boston relies on a mix of actual measurements and modeled calculations. Actual measurements are available for electricity, natural gas, and steam (obtained directly from energy utilities), and all sources related to mass transit, the airport, and water and sewer (obtained from the regional authorities). Regional transportation models are used to calculate vehicle-miles-traveled in Boston, which are then split into diesel and gasoline based on the State diesel and gas consumption split. Then each fuel type is divided into the average fleet mix categories (ICLEI 2009) and the EPA emissions factor for each vehicle type are applied to calculate the GHG. A 10% ethanol content for gasoline is also accounted for.  Fuel oil consumption is estimated based on sampling, U.S. Census data, and some state consumption figures.	Decreased	Overall GHGs decreased by about 2,000 metric tonnes, or 0.03%. This could be in part because there was only a small increase in heating degree days (HDD) from 2013 to 2014 (6.5%), and natural gas used declined more than 4.5%. Meanwhile the electricity emissions factor fell by a few points, while electricity use increased only 1.2%.

De acordo com a análise, os setores Energia e Resíduos apresentaram variação crescente ao longo de todos os períodos de análise. Para o setor IPPU, apenas a comparação 2005-2008 apresentou resultados menores do que o período anterior (2005-2007), com nova tendência de aumento nos demais intervalos subsequentes (devido à redução da produção de cimento em 2008 e retomada da produção nos anos seguintes). Já AFOLU apresentou intervalos irregulares de variação positiva e negativa ao longo do período, com valores negativos para os intervalos 2005-2006, 2005-2008, 2005-2009 e 2005-2010. No ano de variação positiva (2005-2007) as categorias mais representativas em emissões no setor AFOLU (Calagem e Emissões da queima de biomassa) também tiveram variação positiva nesse mesmo período.

50	Buenos Aires	CDP	2014.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	The GHG emissions are calculated by the Buenos Aires EPA Climate Change team using, primarily, IPCC methodology and reporting based on the city-induced framework of the GCP protocol. The city has already completed the BASIC approach.	Decreased	Due to the city mitigation actions, the city´s total GHG emissions have decreased compared to last year. It may be explained, among others factors, because of improvement of the mitigation measures in the Waste Sector: new technologies which have been implemented in order to reduce the volume of waste disposed in landfills. Even though, during 2014, the city recorded the longest heat wave in its history, which has led to an increase in energy consumption for air conditioning and in general a higher residential use of electricity; however, the reductions in the 2014 inventory were achieved by the diminution on natural gas consumption as well as the reductions done in the waste sector,  which in the end managed to diminish the impact of electricity energy subsector. Regarding transport sector, the City has sold little bit less fuel than last year, which is shown in a small decreases of the sector's emissions. Regarding the evolution of total GHG emissions in the period 2000 - 2014, an increase of 17% is observed. However, in the last 10 years (2005- 2014),the increase was 13%. After the implementation of the Action Plan, is relevant to compare the current level of emissions with those prior to the Plan, in 2008. Emissions in 2014 increased only 1.5% compared to 2008.

54	Canberra	CDP	2015.0	CO2; CH4; N2O; HFCs; SF6	The ACT Government receives disaggregated national data each year from the Australian Government which is consistent with the IPCC guidelines. However, the ACT Government is required to record its own electricity, gas and transport data as this is not provided by the national government at the ACT scale.	Increased	The ACT emissions have increased by 4.6% since the last inventory. This is largely due to two external factors. The first is the National repeal of the carbon price, which saw a higher percentage of supplied energy come from fossil fuels, increasing the emissions factor for the electricity grid despite the ACT’s own renewable energy coming online. The second was a below average minimum winter temperatures which are linked to more days requiring heating for households. The slight increase in demand for electricity, coupled with the increased emission factor saw a spike in emissions from the electricity sector compared to last year.

55	Cape Town	CDP	2012.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	During 2014 the City updated its energy profile and released a State of Energy Report in 2015 (based on 2012 data year). All data provided in this CDP submission is based on this report. The process includes: A baseline data collection was collected from the following 5 sectors. Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category.  Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated  into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities. Local Government: all municipal operations, namely council buildings, street and traffic lights, water and wastewater treatment works and municipal vehicle fleet. Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train). The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors. In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor). Also included within the category energy industries is the municipal distribution losses.	Decreased	The City of Cape Town does not update its emissions inventory annually, but rather in a process linked to the update of its entire energy profile, which takes place every 4-5 years. In comparison to its last full inventory data (2007), Cape Town's emissions have decreased due to an increase in electricity efficiency between the reporting years  (2007 and 2012).

63	Chicago	CDP	2015.0	CO2; CH4; N2O		Decreased	Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.

Associated GHG emissions for all activities were calculated using an approach consistent with the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) - U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI) as the main guiding document, with methodologies from The Climate Registry (TCR), the World Resources Institute (WRI), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also referenced. Tools - Inventory Management System: Most of the calculations used to develop this inventory were carried out in an Information Management System (IMS), a Microsoft Excel-based spreadsheet that collects into one tool the original data, methodology applied, emission factors selected and a summary of GHG emission results. The IMS also provides charting, forecasting and benchmarking capabilities	This is our first year of calculation	2010 Baseline Inventory that’s being reported is our 1st comprehensive GHG inventory.

84	Edmonton	CDP	2014.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	Each year we manually collect empirical utility use information from the utilities for natural gas and electricity used within the geographic border of the City of Edmonton. This information is provided to us in various reporting categories such as residential, commercial and industrial. We are now receiving this information at the finest level of granularity that can be provided from the utilities. Propane fuel use for transportation is taken from Statistics Canada as recorded for the Province of Alberta, and then prorated according to the population of Edmonton compared to the population of Alberta. The diesel and gasoline use in litres is done in a similar fashion, but the information in this case is provided to us from the Alberta provincial government. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor. The conversion factors are derived from various sources: electricity grid intensity comes from Statistics Canada - this factor, is always two years behind the calendar year; natural gas and liquid fuels from US Environmental protection Agency, or Natural Resources Canada references, and the local utilities. The data is input manually each year into an excel spreadsheet model, and the conversion factors are checked for updates each year. Reports on the results are sent out on an as needed, customized basis.	Increased	"The changes from the 2013 dataset are as follows:Residential increased slightly, likely due to an increase in about 9,000 customers over the year, commercial increased energy consumption possibly due to a slight expansion in numbers, industrial showed a small decrease in emissions but we can't determine why, it was very much the same as 2013 values. All the vechicle fuel consumption numbers: gasoline, diesel, propane, natural gas for vehicles were very much the same as for 2013, ""Other"" emissions went up slightly due to an increase in some industrial sector emission due to production increases. Overall, total EMISSIONS in 2014 went up by 3.3% over 2013."

101	Greater London	CDP	2013.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	London's inventory is in line with the GPC, but in 2013 does not fully break down emissions according to GPC requirements. Stationary - Published central government datasets used for energy consumption and CO2 emissions from homes (residential buildings) and workplaces (commercial, industrial and government buildings and facilities). Mobile - The London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (in-house model) is used to calculate distances travelled from transport of people and goods by  road, railways, water-borne navigation, aviation, and off-road surface transport. National emissions factors are applied.	Increased	London's absolute CO2 emissions decreased slightly in 2013 on 2012 levels. As London reports its CO2 emissions as non weather-corrected, the decrease in 2013 may be partially due to a milder winter in 2013 compared to 2012, and therefore a higher number of heating degree days in 2012 compared to 2013. The use of coal in electricity generation also decreased at the national level. London's emissions fell by 11% on 1990 levels, and, significantly, despite an unprecedented increase in London's population, London's per capita emissions remain the UK's lowest at 4.8 tonnes.

110	Hamilton, ON	CDP	2012.0	CO2; CH4	Waste information directly from Public Works and reports to Ministry of Environment re: energy capture of methane control at landfill, Transportation and Agriculture data from Statistics Canada Census Industrial (Steel Sector) GHG emissions data reported directly to Canada's National Pollutants Release Inventory (NPRI) Commercial, Residential, Industrial (not Steel) from local electricity and natural gas utilities	Decreased	In 2012 community emissions were estimated at 16,469,283 tonnes, a reduction of - 29% from 2006 emissions levels (estimated at 23,206,135 tonnes). These changes occurred due to the capturing of energy from methane emissions from the Glanbrook landfill, reduced energy demand and shifting of energy from coal as part of the Province’s actions towards the phasing out of coal in Ontario’s energy mixture sources by 2014, a reduction in steel manufacturing, and changing commuting habits and locations of employment. Translated into per capita emissions, the Hamilton community has decreased its emissions by 26% from an estimated 46 tonnes CO2e/person in 2006 to an estimated 34 tonnes CO2e/person in 2011 while population has increased 3%.

149	Johannesburg	CDP	2014.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	The City of Johannesburg 2014 inventory is the first GPC compliant inventory compiled for the City. It builds on the pioneering work undertaken by Siemens who compiled the first inventory for the City for the 2007 calendar year. Siemens prepared the initial report under an arrangement with C40 in 2012, and analyses the high-level changes between the two inventory years.	Decreased	This decrease could be attributed to a number of reasons, for example there seems to be a correlation between it and the drop in electricity consumption. This drop in electricity consumption is mirrored in all the major municipalities in South Africa. There may well be data deficiency artefacts. The real reasons for this decrease and/or other trend that becomes apparent,will become clear as we become more thorough in quality data collection methods. Furthermore, to enhance our understand we will do bottom up data collection at a project level.

Energy use for transportation decreased over 3.5%, largely due to improvements in the average fuel economy of vehicles. In addition to energy savings, changes to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) electricity production portfolio also contributed to emissions reductions, as multiple coal-fired power plants were retired, retrofitted, or replaced by natural gas, nuclear, and renewable sources of energy in recent years.

162	Lakewood	CDP	2007.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	Hybrid Demand-Center Life Cycle Assessment Methodology developed by Ramaswami et. al.: The City of Lakewood GHG Emissions Inventory assesses 2007 GHG emissions using a hybrid demand-center life cycle assessment methodology developed by Ramaswami et. al. The method uses the standard Local Government Operations Protocol (LGOP) released by ICLEI\-Local Governments for Sustainability to report GHG emissions from in-boundary activities. Out-of-boundary activities critical to a community such as the provision of food, water, fuels and dwellings are added to the in-boundary activities to yield an expanded inventory that becomes a more comprehensive “carbon emissions footprint”. In 2015, the City of Lakewood worked with a GHG emissions analyst and updated the 2007 report figures based on more accurate electricity and surface transportation emission factors.	Decreased	We only have a single GHG inventory; however our projections indicate a decrease based on the following reasoning: While the City of Lakewood’s population and material sector emission factors have increased annually, the emission factors for electricity and transportation have decreased annually as a result of the State of Colorado’s Renewable Portfolio Standard and improvements to vehicle fuel efficiency required by the Federal CAFE standards.

173	Lisbon	CDP	2014.0	CO2	The data for the final energy use in the city of Lisbon was obtained from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (www.dgeg.pt). To estimate the emissions from fuel use (scope 1), the emission factors from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories were used. To estimate the emissions from electricity use (scope 2), the emission factor of the Portuguese electric system was obtained from National Energy Balance  from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (www.dgeg.pt). The latest value was used, which refers to 2014 conditions.	Decreased	The decrease in electricity emissions is related with increase of renewables in the national electricity generation mix. The decrease in diesel and gasoline is related with a correction of national statistics of energy for the period 2009-2012, where this figures were overestimated for Lisbon. The 2013 and 2014 values are now correct. Fuel-oil consumption also decreased by conversion to natural gas. Natural gas consumption increase.

176	London, ON	CDP	2014.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	as adapted by ICLEI Canada for use in the FCM's Partners for Climate Protection Program	Increased	"Winter temperatures in 2014 were below normal (i.e., the ""Polar Vortex"") compared to 2013 (normal winter temperatures) and the unusually warm winter of 2012. As a result, overall natural gas use was up by eight percent in 2014 compared to 2013. Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the peak in 2007. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions were 19 percent lower than 2007. In fact, London's emissions in 2014 were six percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to. 
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity are significantly lower in 2014 (about 80 percent) than their peak in 2003. In 2014, only 0.1 percent of Ontario's electricity demand was generated by burning coal as these plants were shut down, and 10 percent was generated by burning natural gas. The rest of Ontario's electricity demand was met with emissions-free generation: 62 percent nuclear, 24 percent hydroelectric, 4 percent wind and other renewables. Conservation and peak demand reduction programs also contribute to lower emissions from power generation. Unfortunately, lower demand from the economic slow-down in manufacturing sector also contributes to lower emissions."

The approach taken to complete the inventory is mostly similar to the one recommended in the Protocol, but there are some differences in content and terminology (e.f. defining inventory boundaries in terms of 'geographic' and 'geographic+' instead of 'basic' and 'basic+'.	Increased	Scope 1 (Stationary Energy and Transport) and Scope 3 (Solid Waste) increased due to the following reasons: a. During daytime, the City's population increases to more than 4 million as people from the Metropolitan Manila and other provinces go to the city to work, shop, do business, or simply dine and be entertained. b. With the increasing population, waste generation also increases. c. Increased construction and development projects are also observed leading to increased in the demand for energy. d. More than 800,000 vehicles traverses the City each day as the City host of three (3) Metro Rail Transit (MRT) and Philippine National Railways (PNR) stations and gateway of four (4) major roads.

185	Manchester	CDP	2013.0	CO2; CH4; N2O; HFCs; PFCs; SF6; NF3	A GPC Compliant dataset has been established for Greater Manchester, including primary data from 2013. This work has been undertaken by Anthesis, who also support the World Resources Institute in the development of Carbon Reduction and emissions reporting and trajectory methodologies and reporting tools.	Decreased	Emissions decreased from is 18.4 to 18 million tonnes between 2012 and 2013. This represents a change from our 2015 GHG emissions tonnage figure.  This is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with  the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport	United Kingdom	Europe			250.0	9.5	2020	0		89.6528245484			79.007	0.0	Mountains	42.9	1.99	1.92	2.32	82.0	39.0	6.7	9.9	39	0.38	0.01	68	79	52.0	73.0	22.0	25.0	103.0	125.0	63.0	37.0	100.0	76.0	68.59	57.0	RA	513.75	556.4375	619.875	1155.6875	1191.5625	1248.3125	0.307738384935	0.318328089245	0.331805560202	0.692261615065	0.681671910755	0.668194439798	336.699877777	4293.23384188	465.270862418	3489.28421693	387.760414609	3605.30173754	3.12342986182	1280.0	2547700.0	1990.390625	71210.3798285	31696.9462698	35029.0	1

With respect to compact basic requirements (first year after the adhesion) only urban railway is missing, we are collecting data regarding this		The most reliable comparison (for data completeness and coherence in the methodology ) can be made with reference to year 2005. CO2 emissions decreased as a whole  This is partially due to a decrease in the electricty national emission factor (due to better technologies and to the increasing quota of renewable energy sources ). Anyway if we calculate the emission inventory in 2005 and 2013 with the same electricity emission factor there is still a decrease in emissions Despite a litlle increase in population there was a reduction both in the bulding and in the mobility sector. Regarding buildings there was a progressive fuel switch from diesel oils to methane, more efficient boilers, an extension of the district heating service and a reduction in domestic electricity consumption.

202	Nashville and Davidson	CDP	2014.0	CO2; CH4; N2O		Increased	There was a small increase since the 2011 inventory, which was an incomplete inventory due to limited availability of data. Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame. LEED certification and Energy Star are examples of growing programs that help improve building energy efficiency.

209	North Vancouver	CDP	2015.0	CO2; CH4	Emissions data comes from multiple sources and the City relies on other agencies, such as privately owned utility companies to provide consumption data. As a result, the City cannot comment on the accuracy of the data.	Other: 2015 data reported as 2016 data not available	Comparisons are not possible at this time, as the next year's data (2016) are not yet available.  We are thus still reporting 2015 data as before (note that our emissions data submitted April 2016 - for the year 2010 - were updated for the Compact of Mayors module submitted in December 2016 - for the year 2015).  However, due to limitations associated with the data, year to year comparisons must be made with caution. In general, emissions over the past few years appear to be staying the same or potentially decreasing slightly despite population increases.  This is likely due to more efficient building construction, reduction in solid waste tonnages, increased recycling and organics diversion, and increased fuel efficiency standards.

Increased	We havn`t used the full GPC-methodology for more than one year so we can`t tell if the emissions have increased or decreased. But due to the numbers from Statistics Norway, we can conclude that there has been a slight increase. The main reason is growth in emissions from Off road-transportation.

219	Philadelphia	CDP	2012.0	CO2; CH4; N2O; HFCs; PFCs; SF6	In general the ICLEI protocol was followed, however in some cases data was not available in the same fashion or format as described in the protocol. Electricity, natural gas and steam usage was provided by the local utilities. Data related to onsite combustion of fuels was derived using the American Communities Surveys and allocated to Philadelphia based on population. Emissions from transportation was derived using the local regional planning commission's transportation model and EPA MOVES. EPA's non road emissions model was used for off road vehicles Industrial emissions were estimated by looking at EPAs GHG reporting project data and comparing it to previously known information from utilities. Waste data was modeled using MSW and private collection data along with local landfill and incinerator emissions based on total waste.

226	Pittsburgh	CDP	2013.0	CO2; CH4; N2O		Decreased	There has been significant variation in the way that data was collected an reported, and Pittsburgh had about 30,000 fewer residents in 2013 compared to 2003. Recalculating 2003 and 2008 inventories to compare to the 2013 inventory shows that emissions have decreased by about 4% since the 2008 inventory, but have still increased by 10% since 2003. Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region. Natural gas emissions increased almost three-fold since 2003.

238	Ravenna	CDP	2014.0	CO2	The Emission Inventory (MEI)  is updated within the Sustainable Energy Action Plan. It is based on the methodology and toolkit developed by ARPA ER (Environmental Protection Agency of Emilia-Romagna Region) within the instrument IPSI (Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the Covenant of Mayors - Italian version). The methodology was improved and adapted by a specific working group “Climate Plan”  at regional level including the main cities and Provinces. The background knowledge is based on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory realized by the Region with the support of ARPA ER, following standard estimation methodologies, internationally recognized (IPCC, CORINAIR). The MEI includes: direct emissions of the Municipality considered as an organization with its own consumptions; indirect emissions, generated by activities within the Municipal area estimated by ARPA ER as a breakdown of the regional inventory.

241	Reykjavík	CDP	2013.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	Well, this is the total emissions as we only calculate scope 1. As I understand scope 1 this is scope 1 emissions, due to activities of citizens and businesses within the city limits, waste and flight / shipping. Emissions from energy generation is not included. That kind of emission is though very low as our energy and district heating runs on Hydro power and geothermal heat. We are not counting emissions from activities outside of the borders of the city, such as emissions from the international airport which is outside of Reykjavik and not the emissions of any production outside of the city which I understand is scope 3.	Increased	Emissions from traffic has  increased by 2% since 2011. Estimation of GHG emissions from aviation, fishing and sailing have increased by 19% since 2011. The most significant part of the increase is in navigation (passenger, cargo and other ships).

252	San Francisco	CDP	2012.0	CO2; CH4; N2O	Used ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol to verify calendar year 2012 emissions.  During November 2015, the city reshaped and scoped calendar year 2012 emissions according to the new GPC BASIC framework to Compact of Mayors requirements.  The GPC expanded the scope of the verified 2012 inventory to report sources such as from natural gas leakage from the distribution system, district electricity, transmission and distribution electric losses, wastewater, agriculture/farming, ships and boats (non-ferry), off-road equipment and stationary sources.  This resulted in a higher emission number than originally verified by a third party.	Other	Methology Change: There was an increase in the emission number from inventory years 2010 to 2012.  The shift to the BASIC GPC framework during 2015 included categories that were otherwise excluded or not calculated during previous CDP reporting years.  Rather than rectify previous years, especially under the new GPC BASIC categories in which historic data is largely unavailable, CDP/COM reports will include these categories moving forward. However, to capture emission trends since 1990, the City will continue trending according to previously utilized ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol scopes in which case sectors such as Residential, Commercial/Industrial, Transportation (private, commercial, public/mass transit), Waste as well as Municipal emissions continues to decrease due to the City of San Francisco's progressive climate policies and commitment to implementing effective emission reduction strategies.

264	Seattle	CDP	2012.0	CO2; CH4; SF6	Please see detailed source notes throughout the inventory document.	Decreased	The total amount of GHGs emitted from the core emissions sources has declined 6% between 2008 and 2014, from 3.7 to 3.5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e).  However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.

279	Stockholm	CDP	2015.0	CO2; CH4; N2O		Decreased	Total emissions from the categories in Stockholm estimates at system boundaries have been reduced significantly over the past 10 years. Meanwhile, the population has grown by about 200 000 inhabitants. In Stockholm, it can be said that the reduction in per capita emissions by half will depend on the actual response, half of the population growth. The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. Electricity use is however quite constant. The car traffic is constant in the last years even though the population has increased. However, there has been an increase in truck traffic. The overall greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is constant over the last years.

283	Sydney	CDP	2015.0	CO2; CH4; N2O; HFCs; PFCs; SF6; NF3	Traditionally the City of Sydney has calculated city-wide GHG emissions based on the CCAP reporting tool by Kinesis - a private consultancy commissioned by the City. Recently the City has also developed GPC BASIC inventories for the 2005/06, 2013/14 and  2014/15 years to be compliant with the Compact of Mayors. The GPC BASIC inventories show lower emissions compared with inventories based on the CCAP tool due to different methodologies and emissions sources. Future year’s reports may be subject to change as the City of Sydney will be updating its inventories in the short term for achieving beyond GPC BASIC compliance.	Decreased	City of Sydney emissions have decreased due to cleaning of the grid, increased network costs leading to greater awareness and behaviour change (indicating there is some price elasticity in electricity consumption), improved energy efficiency, uptake of solar PV installations and weather influences.

294	Toronto	CDP	2013.0	CO2	Currently, Toronto’s emissions calculations focus on our major emissions sources – energy (heating and cooling), transportation (mobile sources), and waste. a. Energy Heating and Cooling: The City of Toronto’s emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are updated annually and based on the National Inventory Reports (Environment Canada); however, the City of Toronto adds a 10% transmission loss to the NIR figure. Additionally, data is acquired from Toronto Hydro and Enbridge Gas on the electricity and natural gas consumption of the entire city, including residential, industrial, commercial, institutional etc...b. Transportation: Data are collected and standardized only for car and truck traffic through the City using four main sources: -truck traffic counts of over 2,000 intersections throughout the city from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division -accumulated traffic count data from years 1987 to 2009 from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division --a Canadian standard developed by a Canadian consultant. The above traffic data is then used to calculate “vehicle kilometers traveled” (VKT) and emissions factors for vehicle types are applied to calculate total emissions from mobile sources. c. Waste: Tonnages of waste and approximate waste compositions are used in mass balance equations in the calculation of emissions from landfills.	Decreased	a.  Eliminating the use of coal in the electricity mix which facilitated substantive per capita reductions in energy consumption b.  Significantly reducing the amount of waste going to landfill, and therefore, the amount of methane gas generated. Our transportation emissions have remained the same because we have not been able to update this data for the year 2012 and so we used the same data from 2011 for our inventory.
